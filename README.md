# Five Night's At Jerald's

FNAJ is a fan-game based on the FNAF series. This repository is mainly to keep a backup of the game, however can also be used to add/edit sprites(if you're so kind :) ).



## Installation and how to edit
If you want to edit the files, maybe add/change a sprite, code, music, etc. Or maybe you just want to snoop around, here's how to do so. Just so you know, there's probably a different method to editing the repository but heres my recommended way. Install [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/). Then once you've logged in, go to this site again and press open with github desktop. ![The button showing to open the repo in Github Desktop](Assets/github-stuff-don't-touch/image1.png) 
Then when it's open, just clone it and start editing! And once you're finished, commit to a new branch and create a pull request!
## Software Needed
The Software Needed to edit the repository are the following listed below(just so you know you ONLY need this software if you're editing that specific thing, ex: unity 6 is NOT needed to edit assets):
1. Krita, krita is used for the assets and can be edited by downloading the .kra files, the png files are meant for the game, and also don't contain the layers, so yeah please use the .kra files.
2. Unity, unity is needed to edit anything in the game engine, and editing code also requires Visual Studio, however it comes with an unity installation. YOU WILL NEED UNITY 6000.1.1f1, ANYOTHER VERSION USED WILL NOT BE MERGED!!!

And so far that's it, stuff like music can be made with anything you use, just include the software used in the commit description.
